# BarefeetMV.hissabu 👣

**A Maldivian-inspired reimagining of the classic puzzle game *Threes*.**

BarefeetMV.hissabu is a calm, deliberate number puzzle that rewards foresight and rhythm over speed. Built as a single-file HTML5 game, it runs offline, installs as a PWA, and plays beautifully on mobile and desktop.

## 🌊 About the Game

BarefeetMV.hissabu follows **strict Threes rules**:

- **1 + 2 → 3**
- Tiles **3 and above merge only with identical values**
- One new tile spawns per move
- Next tile preview is always visible
- **Single-move undo**, exactly like the original game

The experience is wrapped in a **Maldivian lagoon night aesthetic**, with soft motion, island-inspired colors, and optional **Dhivehi language tiles** for a culturally grounded experience.

This is not a clone or an experiment — it is a focused, respectful puzzle built for long-term play.
